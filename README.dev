Running
-------

To run:

  $ ./dev

DFU
---

DFU over TFTP can be initiated:

  => dhcp ${kernel_addr_r} capsule.itb
  => dfu tftp ${kernel_addr_r}

This will start but writes to flash will fail because the flash is in secure world.

Capsule
-------

A capsule binary is generated in `output/images/capsule.bin`.

Capsule update:

  => dhcp ${kernel_addr_r} capsule.bin
  => efidebug capsule update -v ${kernel_addr_r}

This will fail for now.
